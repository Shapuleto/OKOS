            <p><br />
              I am  Grégoire du Boullay,  53 years old.  I grew up in Switzerland and  then in France.  I am the Director of Development at Novalto  in Paris.  I am the proud father of 2  wonderful children.  I adopted  in 1997 my son, Lucas, in Vietnam and  in 2002 daughter, Anouk, in Cambodia. <br />
              <br />
For a long time, the lives of children in poor countries deeply affected  me.  Finally, in 2014, I decided to  launch my project.  <br />
<br />
<img src="img/citations-sinoza-english.jpg" width="764" height="107" /><br />
</p>
            <p>The  main catalysts that made me think about this project were the many changes in  my personal circumstances.   They allowed  me to work on myself, my priorities and my values.  I became aware of the meaning of life,  «&nbsp;my life&nbsp;».   This  self-awareness allowed me to “find myself”&nbsp;and to not have any regrets by  setting up a project near and dear to my heart. <br />
  <br />
              I was raised in a family where trying  and succeeding were extremely important   However, I did not follow the traditional  education system.   I stopped my education after completing my  Bac.  Then, I decided to return to school  at the age of 40 when I got my Executive MBA at HEC.  <br />
  <br />
              Immersed   in this entrepreneurship, I learned to master business skills and  “start-up&quot; fascinated me. So currently , I am helping and supporting other people’s projects as a consultant  and / or investor and  to carry out their  business plans, while working as an employee. <br />
            </p>
            <p>Two  significant events in my life have led to my decision to launch this project  today : </p>
            <p><br />
              First moment&nbsp;:<br />
              In 2002, I adopted my daughter, Anouk Mealea, in Cambodia.  During this trip, I met Mr. And Mrs.  Despalieres who had founded the association, «&nbsp;Pour un sourire  d’enfants&nbsp;» in 1995.  In order to  better explain their inspiration, they took me to the rubbish dumps in Phnom  Penh where hundreds of families lived  in  abject poverty. <br />
              Thirteen years after this event, I understood that it was now my turn to lead  and support a humanitarian effort .  First,  we established an association, «&nbsp;Cambodge Enfance  Développement&nbsp;»  with some of the  parents who had adopted children from the same orphanage.    With this adoption process , I discovered a universe where I  wanted to get involved and a means to make it happen.  <br />
  <br />
              Second  moment&nbsp;: <br />
              While working for Novalto, I had  the pleasure to meet and work with its founder.   He had enormous trust in me, trust that I never had before. Thanks to  him,  I saw myself through his eyes and  gained confidence in myself.  I am  forever grateful.  </p>
            <p>Albert Einstein said &nbsp;:  «&nbsp;I have no special talent.  I am  only passionately curious.&nbsp;» . This quote speaks to me because it  expresses how «&nbsp;passionately curious» I am. </p>
            <p>I have been travelling around the  world since I was 18 : USA, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Egypt, Morocco,  Kenya, Ivory Coast, China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia,  Thailand, Laos, and most recently, Costa Rica.  </p>
            <p>These countries awakened my  curiosity.  They brought me so much in  terms of the travelers and locals that I met, the different cultures and the  shared  smiles.   A smile is a universal language!  Nothing is better than a child’s smile which  makes me happy!</p>
            <p>&nbsp;<br />
              I met Yehudi Menuhin in Switzerland  when I was 14.  This man impressed  and inspired me by his “empathy” and his  “goodwill”.  I am particularly fond of  these two words. <br />
  &nbsp;<br />
              Indeed, these words resonate inside  my head with the project that I am launching today.  It is not just a donation or a limited  involvement.  It is to totally commit  myself to a project devoted to children in need.  I want to provide them with access to  education and to school : to Learn.     Throughout our lives, we learn.   Regardless of my professional skills and my life experiences,  I still   have a lot to learn from these kids.   Life is for learning!</p>
            <p>Audrey Hepburn, at a crossroads in  her life, said «&nbsp;As you grow older, you will discover that you have two  hands, one for helping yourself, the other for helping others. ».</p>
            <p>I want to give new meaning to my  life and dedicate myself to helping vulnerable children. </p>
            <p>I began with a quote by Spinoza and  will end with him:<br />
